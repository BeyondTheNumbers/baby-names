Another end of chapter challenge of Lynda.com course on using Python for data analysis

This project is the solution to an end of chapter challenge of a Lynda.com course on using Python for data analysis that I completed a while ago.

Lynda.com Python: Data Analysis Chapter 7: Baby Names with Pandas

Challenge: From a list of baby names maintained by the Social Security Administration:

1) Compute the number of times that each name was used, separately for boys and girls
2) Identify the unisex names where the ratio between boys' and girls' totals is between 1-to-4 and 4-to-1
3) Plot popularity vs. year for the top ten unisex names

The goal here was again to write simple code in a relatively short period of time, but I included a number of comments on how to make it more sophisticated and/or efficient if one chooses to iterate and/or scale at a later time.

I cleaned up the code a bit, and included more comments, but otherwise left the original code mostly unaltered. Some of the basic code snippets are introduced in the Lynda.com course tutorial, but most code is entirely my own; the objectives were different enough from the tutorial, so it made more sense to start from scratch. All of the comments are my own, and I did not copy-and-paste anything without understanding.
